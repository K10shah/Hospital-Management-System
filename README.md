# Hospital-Management-System
(currently in the implementation phase)

This project is a part of the course work for <a href='https://catalog.buffalo.edu/courses/index.php?abbr=CSE&num=522'>CSE 522 : Object Oriented Analysis, Design and Implementation</a>.

The objective of this project is to understand and implement the concepts of object oriented programming by prototyping a large scale software system on a smaller scale. 

In this project we are implementing a system to manage the workings of a Hospital.

<b>Version 1</b>
This is the initial release of this project and it will only contain a command line interface for the user to interact with the system.
Also many functionalities won't be implemented in this version.
